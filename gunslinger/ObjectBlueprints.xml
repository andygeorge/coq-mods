    <part Name="Description" Short="This is the gun of a true gunslinger, having been passed down through the ages from Arthur Eld himself. Its barrel and eight-round chamber were made using the melted down blue-grey steel of the sword, Excalibur, and have the rose, the sign of the Eld, engraved in the side. The sandalwood grip of the gun has never lost its fragrance." />
